Applied Data Science with MySQL
Watershed Properties is a residential property management company.

Like most traditional property managers, Watershed has thus far exclusively managed long-term leases.
The Real Estate business has begun extending into a different market: short-term rentals.
Sensitivity analyses utilizing MySQL techniques and queries will be presented in this Data Science to develop a profitable plan for how Watershed should enter into the short-term rental market.
